- **trait** also has the actual method bodies. In other words, a trait adds code to an interface. This is the new thing that Swift 2.0 lets us do today with protocol extensions.
- **mixin** is like a trait but it also has state. We can’t really do this yet with Swift 2.0 as you’re not allowed to add stored properties to protocols.

## Unsafe Swift

- withUnsafeMemory
- **UnsafePointer<T>, UnsafeRowPointer**
- **UnsafeMutablePointer<T>, UnsafeMutableRowPointer**
- withUnsafeBytes
- same 4 pointer types, except there are operation with buffer instead of single pointer
- **implicit conversion from variable to pointer using inout syntax**
- 2 rules working with pointer types:
	1. never escape the pointer you get in a withUnsafe- function, and
	2. never, ever get the pointer to a variable through implicit conversion
