# 2016

- UIActivityIndicator view can be used as tableview accessory view
- to display popover on iPhone - set delegate and return none from style method
- better include primitives in complex data types, rather than subclass it. Override only need to re-implement low-level behaviour
- UIStackView: hidden property animatable and hidden views are not displayed
- **initWithFrame: - code & initWithCoder: - xib**
- target and action doesn’t work for UIBarButton with custom view
- layoutIfNeeded animatable change constraints
- UILayoutGuide instead of dummy views
- NSDictionaryOfVariableBindings
- No deallocation in size-classes between elements
- @syncronized(self.property) { read/write self.property}
- when frame of the view changes
	- view removed from the superview then it will be called on superview
	- in UIScrollview, during scrolling
	- while adding the view to superView
	- during orientation 

- write specific code for specific cell types
- perform rounding of all pixel-relating data: point coordinates, heights/widths
- track your graphical resources: **images must be pixel-perfect**, else when they will be rendered on Retina displays, it will be doing with unnecessary antialiasing
- **periodically recheck your situation** with this problem because it can changes very quickly
- find render bottlenecks which don’t allow you to return cells very fast
move operations to background thread and refresh displayed content on the main thread
- last resort is setting up your CALayers for asynchronous displaying mode (even if they are about simple text or images) — this will help you to increase FPS
- **more subviews you have, less quickly autolayout works**

- **UIRequiresFullScreen** used this to disable split mode in iPad
- nullable — Think UIView?
- nonnull — Think UIView
- null_unspecified — Think UIView!
- scroll inset affects on initial layout (own experience)

#### CoreAnimation Notes

- four different tree in iOS: view/layer(model)/presentation/render
- contents(id), contentsScale, contentsGravity, maskToBounds
- sprites. contentsRect & contentsCenter
- CALayerDelegate, displayLayer: or drawLayer:: better use drawRect: in UIView
- **why Apple recommends NOT use empty `drawRect:`?**
- properties: position(a. k. a. center), frame, bounds
- **frame is just computed from bounds, transform, position**
- anchorPoint in unit
- zPosition is very low value
- prefer views over layers
- hitTest & convertPoint
- beginReceivingRemoteControlEvents / endReceivingRemoteControlEvents in UIApplication
- **border inside and before all inner contents**
- shadowOpacity (0) / shadowColor / shadowOffset (CGSize) / shadowRadius
- shadow match contents
- if content overflows - shadow will be dropped with clipsToBounds
- shadowPath
- mask for CALayer
- minificationFilter / magnificationFilter with bilinear / trilinear / nearest
- UIViewGroupOpacity YES
- shouldRasterize / rasterizatoinScale
- **shear transform - not an affine transform**
- `CATransform3D`
- **m34** perspective
- backfaces and **doubleSided** property
- **handling events rely on zIndex nor on appearance order**
- layer containsPoint and convertPoint
- **mainBundle is immutable for writing**
- layerClass class method in the UIView class
- keyframe animation and transition with view - that works with snapshots
- **leading (line spacing) & kerning (spacing between letters)**
- substringFromIndex - from index do not include
- CATiledLayer integrates nicely with scroll view using CALayer delegate
- CA not support autoresizing or auto layout
- **viewForKey: in animation could be nil**

- **it’s slower to insert or delete elements from a mutable array than a set or a dictionary**
- diff -u $FILE-OLD $FILE-NEW
- CALayer animated automatically
- CATransaction / begin / commit / duration / completion block
- UIView beginAnimations:context: / commitAnimations
- **WHY DOES UIVIEW DISABLE IMPLICIT ANIMATIONS?**
- CATransaction setDisableActions:
- `CATransition`
- long and long long - int types
- blur - **CIFilter** & **UIImage+ImageEffects** (slower)
- better use in background thread

#### Google search master
 
- Site:
- `-word`
- time ranges
- define:word

- leave from value nil. Will use current value - for animation where specify from and to
scrollPoint scrollRectToVisible
smb 445 - for connection windows and mac
addAnimation:forKey: - key uniquely identifies animation
cakeyframe animation doesn’t know about initial value
catransition. Always key @"transition"
there are difference between type and subtype
difference push / move in / reveal
capture layer in context to image
repeatCount and repeatDuration
CAMediaTimingProtocol
beginTime & timeOffset, speed
duration / begin time / time offset / speed / repeat count / repeat duration will impact on children layer / animation 
fill mode - when animation could take frame before or after itself
if you are not use remove on completion -> use custom key for remove it manually
media time for device

the fewer conditions you test for, the better your code “tastes"
voip to prevent close socket, location to wake up program, for leaving location, and local notification to wake up program
uicontrol subclass of uiview with adding target / action pattern
media timing function
easing
keyframe animation - timing functions [keyframes - 1 for count]
get values at index for point in timing function
two approach - timer base animation and keyframe based - 60 frames per second
every thread in running in nsrunloop
CADisplayLink - specific draw timer
different work in cadisplay link versus nstimer
NSDefaultRunLoopMode
NSRunLoopCommonModes
UITrackingRunLoopMode
add in run loop with several modes

// 16.11
instance variable in initializer
srong or weak reference to outlet? Depends on root
for in faster than for
formal and informal protocol - as NSObject category

// 17.11
layout -> display -> prepare (in render server) -> commit -> calculates values -> render
cpu-bound: geometry - overdraw - offscreen drawing - large images
gpu-bound: layout calculation, lazy view loading, cg drawing, image decompression
measure, don’t guess!

// 18.11
cg for vector drawing
dirty rectangles - means rect need to be redrawn
async drawing
image decompression
for fast decompression image can drawn at cg context - deferred decompression
imageNamed - auto cached and decompression or use tile layer for same effect
resolution swapping for fast-scrolling collection
NSCache
offscreen rendering
shape layer better than pure cg drawing
blending, clipping
reduce layer count
load as demand
renderInContext:
if layer is not attached to view hierarchy it will not impact on render process

// 21.11
string additionally wraps with quotes in predicate
@dynamic tell that accessor will be provided at runtime
predicate %K for key
indexOfObjectPassingTest:
complete / none / complete until already open / complete until first authenticate
check if Class object is nil - for newer iOS
call window method makeAnyKey from will finish
SF-UI in iOS 

// 22.11
runloop with current thread. As default is not launched
autorelease at each iteration
autorelease for whole application - why? Generate new object. Directly Application
reason for using NSThread
NSPort and successors for communication between threads
when we need runloop? - for task which will have own thread
for all objects <NSCopying> use copy instead of retain (strong)

//  23.11
read - do not make from READING list
do - do not read from DOING LIST
be consistent
and make your plan alive with 2 weeks goal

// 25.11
use similar conventions for test
don't let ourselves in HDD(Hype)
triple A - arrange, act, assert
mocks and stubs
for test use primates equal and non-primitives equalObjects
IGList library

// 26.11
no dictionaries use objects
copy, new, mutable copy, alloc implicitly call retain 
Property set: retain new, release old, assign to instance
cocoa establishes a convention, therefore, that a “parent” object should maintain strong references to its “children,” and that the children should have weak references to their parents
collections own objects

// 26.11
print[p] and expression[e]. What else can we gte from debugger?
finish
thread return 
frame info - frame from stack
modifying program
custom actions

// 30.11
lazy loading difference in xib / storyboards. What you can say about it?

// 04.12
hash for set
DispatchQueue
System Sound Services 

// 05.12
0.0 in graphics context impacts give retina scale - 1/2/3

// 06.12
nsfilemanager / defaultManager / currentDirectoryPath
NSTemporaryDirectory
remove directory - remove item at path
contents of directory at path

// 07.12
UIPresentationController - what is it and for what?

// 09.12
custom operation, that can be cancelled. Async operation
File Manager
check if file exists
compare two files
check if file read/write/exec/deletable
move / remove / extract to data
file handle 
working with offset of cursor
writing data on with cursor always override existing data

// 11.12
centre line ⌃ + L
delete entire line ⌃ + K
auto adjust scroll insets - property in UIViewController
assume unchanged
atomic always read proper data
nonatomic little faster
readwrite in extension

// 13.12
uisearchcontroller
ui search bar can defines scope underneath
memory barrier - for multithread programming
PersonNameComponents

// 21.12
ascii 7bit
code page - one encoding
unicode transformation format
byte order mask
utf-8
directory read vs directory execute
if we need compare unicode strings -> use normalised form of it

// 22.12
work with round corner. Don’t need to rechange underlaying layer. Just apply the mask
traits - methods bodies
mixin has state
it’s recommended to remove “Host Application” from your Unit Test target configuration and run your tests without your application running on simulator

// 23.13
updating table will not give 60 fps - begin/end
we can catch gesture for web view
opaque layers
way to cache - offscreen rendering
green/yellow/red for offscreen rendering 
context stack for ui kit
argb vs xrgb
context per thread 

// 24.12
unix: ok -> doesn't show anything 
code signing works with no exceptions
entitlement is for specific system resources 
PEM and CMS formats for encoding
provision profile list all available certificates 
we can use images, gifs and videos in custom notifications 

// 25.12
load vs initialise for class. Load always invokes
swizzling in dispatch once
selector - string, that represents function name
typedef struct objc_selector *SEL
typedef struct objc_method *Method
imp - pointer to the start of the function
class - table of methods - each method - table with selector and implementation
storyboards can load custom fonts

// 26.12
contents rating
responds to selector either instance or class
C function is NULL

// 27.12
Restoration process
encoding
ask for restoration class / app delegate / restoration identifier / miss it
encode / decode restorable state of controller
selection range for text fields
application encode additional state
force quit does not allow to preserve state of application
voip push notification
NSStackBlock / NSGlobalBlock
for stack block use copy, it is located at stack, and retain has no power
if you need a genuinely separate copy, recreate the block, don't copy it

// 28.12
SwiftyJSON is the niece lib for extracting values from json. Not for mapping

// 30.12
6 hours away from coffee / alcohol
exercising and 2 cups of water
15 minutes delta
fresh air & glass of water and cold water
do not check emails, socials, other stuff

// 31.12
entry point as a destination controller for testing
the best way to perform expandable cell - deal with plist
get IMP of current method is a little tricky, so we can use __builtin_return_address(0) in gcc
action sheet, popover and alert
full screen with main done/save/agree and cancel
