# objc. Advanced Swift

>>> TLDR; Very good book, event for intermediate programmers. Mark - 9 / 10

This book full of detail explanation how generics / protocol types works, what are existential containers. Furthemore there are only one chapter for Swift introducing. I suggest that you should read it.
