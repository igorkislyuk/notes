# Swift 3 Functional Programming by Dr. Fatih Nayebi

>>> TLDR; Not so bad for newbies. Mark - 5 / 10

- `stride(from:to:by)`
- tail recursion is final expression in recursion call
- memoization is wrapping mutable dictionary in function call
- compound types / named types
- tuple / constant / identifier pattern matching
- generic typealiases
- numeric types
- using generic types in extension
- `functor` is any structure that we can `map` over
- `applicative functor` is functor that we can `apply` over
- `monad` is any structure we can `flatMap` over
- `@noescape` means that argument will no longer lives that the call
- `semigroup` isset of elements with binary operation. 2 elements call create semigroup with associative operation
- `monoid` is a set with binary opearation. Property - associativity, identity of elements
- **Abstract Data Types**: tree / binary tree / list / lazy list.
- `@autoclosure` - auto wrapping argument in closure
- `@escaping` - closure will last longer that lifetime of the scope that it is declared in.
- `Lens` fucntional wrapper over property
- interface segregation
- dependency inversion
